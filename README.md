If you want to run this app on your system you will
need to clone this repo, then in your terminal run
'npm install'. This will install all of the required
dependencies that this app needs to run.

Open your code editor and in your terminal run
'npm run server' this will run the server on 
localhost:5000. Use localhost:5000/tasks/ to see 
the data in JSON Format in your browser.

In a second terminal run 'npm start' this will 
start the React Development Server in which the
app will run and from there you are able to interact
with the UI. This will usually load automatically,
if this is not the case use localhost:3000 to view
